# ScienceExpo22Algorithms
## Project for a Science Fair
### Partnered with [Mathew Team](https://github.com/MTeem)

This program was used to grab data to insert into tables onto google sheets.

## Objective
Our objective was to find what sorting algorithm was the best for what scenario when sorting large integer lists (100,000 items)

### Sorting algorithms used
* Bubble
* Selection
* Insertion
* Merge
* Heap
* Shell
